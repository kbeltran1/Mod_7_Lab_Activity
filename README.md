# Mod_7_Lab_Activity
This lab activity creates a variety of programs. From giving a radius to get the area of a circle to drawing a series of nested squares through the turtle module to taking out the unique numbers from a list of numbers. Overall, we are using def to define elements of a program to be used later without repetition of the same lines of code.
